## "Curiosity is the engine of creation."

Welcome to my code portfolio! Here you will find my most recent professional code.

I am a junior data scientist with several years of full-time software QA and tech support experience to my name. 

I am looking for full-time employment in a data science role, and you may view [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankserafine/) for more info about me.

### Project CAP (Crime Analysis & Prediction)

In my repositories, you will find a repo for `ProjectCAP`, which is the culmination of 12 weeks of brainstorming, data engineering, data wrangling, machine learning modeling, and critical analysis. In it, I attempt to contextualize a period of criminal activity by having an ensemble of models establish an expected level of crime, given eight prior years of data to train on.

I also have a [Tableau Public portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/frank.serafine) with interactive dashboards and visualizations of the data involved in Project CAP. 

### Ongoing Work

Because I am beginning my data science work, I will be continually adding repositories as I dig deeper into research. I believe that if you aren't continually learning, you're backsliding. 

Thank you for reading my introduction! Please check out my work and contact me if you like what you see.
