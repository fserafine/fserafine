## "Curiosity is the engine of creation."

Welcome to my code portfolio! Here you will find my most recent professional code.

I am a junior data scientist with several years of full-time software QA and tech support experience to my name. I am looking for full-time employment in a data science role.


### Project CAP (Crime Analysis & Prediction)

In my repositories, you will find a repo for `CrimePrediction`, which is the culmination of 12 weeks of brainstorming, data engineering, data wrangling, machine learning modeling, and critical analysis. In it, I attempt to use an ensemble of models to establish an expected level of crime over two years, given eight prior years of data to train on.

I also have a [Tableau Public portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/frank.serafine) with visualizations of the data involved in Project CAP. Below is a preview of the main dashboard highlighting offender, offense, victim, and time series information.

### Ongoing Work

Because I am beginning my data science work, I will be continually adding repositories as I dig deeper into research. I believe that if you aren't continually learning, you're backsliding.
