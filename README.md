## "Curiosity is the engine of creation."

Welcome to my personal code portfolio! Here you will find my most recent personal coding. I also have extensive contributions to the private repositories of my employers, which can be made available in an anonymized format upon request.

I am currently a Data Analyst and Analytics Engineer and consider myself a Data-Scientist-in-training.  
I have several years of full-time software QA experience, tech support experience, and analytics engineering experience otherwise.

You may view [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankserafine/) for more info about me.

### Independent Work:

__Project CAP (Crime Analysis & Prediction)__

In my repositories, you will find a repo for `ProjectCAP`, which is the culmination of 12 weeks of brainstorming, data engineering, data wrangling, machine learning modeling, visualization, and critical analysis. In it, I attempt to contextualize a period of criminal activity by having an ensemble of ml models establish an expected level of crime, given eight prior years of data to train on.

[Here is a short 3-minute video](https://www.loom.com/share/ac4fc299da284e97834777db89726429) explaining the work and my findings.

I also have a [Tableau Public portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/frank.serafine) with interactive dashboards and visualizations of the data involved in Project CAP. 

Thank you for reading my introduction! Please check out my work and contact me if you like what you see.
